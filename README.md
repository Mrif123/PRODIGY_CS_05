# Network Packet Analyzer

Developed a Network Packet analyzer a crucial tool for monitoring and analyzing Network traffic using the parameters such as Source IP,destination IP,protocol used such as UDP or TCP with the protocol number 17 and 6 respectively and a payload field.

The Network packet analyzer captures,inspects and analyzes the data packets traversing over a network.This allows for the identification of potential security threats,performance issues and unusual network activity.By examing the packet header and payloads,this tool helps in enhancing network security and optimizing performance using the scapy module of python.

⚠️Caution or a critical reminder:
Note that network packet analysis should only be conducted in controlled,educational environments or with proper authorization.Unauthorized use or analysis on live networks without permission can lead to legal consequences and compromise network integrity.

The some glimpses of the network analysis on the connected wi-fi network is attached below:
